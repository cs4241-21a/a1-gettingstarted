## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the body, h1-3 selectors.
   - body: styled background color, text color, and font for all tags in the body
   - h1-3: styled the font for the h1, h2, and h3 selectors

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Bungee Inline and Open Sans fonts from Google Fonts**: I used Bungee Inline as the font for the header tags in my site. I used Open Sans as the font for all other elements on the page (p and ul/li elements).
