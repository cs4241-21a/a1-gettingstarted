Assignment 1 - Hello World: Basic Deployment w/ Git, GitHub, Glitch
===

*DUE: Monday, August 30th by 11:59 AM (before the start of class!)*  

This assignment is a "warm-up" exercise. 
You will simply deploy the starting Web site that you will use this term to [Glitch](http://www.glitch.com/). 

Treat this assignment as a chance to get up to speed on Git, GitHub, and Glitch. 
If you already know these, great! 
However, if you're new to them, spend several hours practicing, experimenting, and reading documentation. Don't just get your website up and done, as
you'll need skills with these tools throughout the rest of the course.

Assignment details
---

This assignment requires that your website is both contained in a GitHub repository and hosted in Glitch. There are two ways to do this:

1. Fork this repo and clone it to your computer, make changes locally on your computer, push the repo onto GitHub, and then import your GitHub repo into Glitch.
2. Fork this repo and then import it directly to Glitch, use the Glitch editor to make changes, and then export your repo from Glitch back to GitHub.
3. Same as #1, but instead of importing from Github to Glitch you just upload the files (or copy/paste) them directly to Glitch.

## Option 1 - Clone to computer, push to Github, import to Glitch (recommended)

1. Fork the starting project code in GitHub. This repo contains:
    * the server code, `server.js`
    * A starting `index.html` file that you will edit as described below
    * A package.json file that helps configure Glitch
    * This README
2. Edit `index.html` to show the following information about you:
    * your name and class at WPI (e.g. class of 2020) Note: Do not put any contact or personal information that you do not potentially want other people outside of this class to see.
    * your major(s) and minor(s)
    * previous computer science courses that you have taken at WPI
    * your experience with the following technologies and methods (none, some, a lot)
        * HTML
        * CSS
        * Java
        * JavaScript
        * Ruby
        * Python
        * unit testing
4. Complete some technical and/or design achievements (see below).
5. Test your project to make sure that when someone goes to your main page, it displays correctly. You can do this locally by simply running `node server.js` from within the assignment directory.

6. Modify the README file according to the specification below.
7. Commit and push all your changes to GitHub. 
8. Deploy your project to Glitch. You can do this by [importing the repo from GitHub](https://medium.com/glitch/import-code-from-anywhere-83fb60ea4875)
9. Ensure that your project has the proper naming scheme (guide follows) so we can find it.
9. Create and submit a Pull Request to the original repo.

## Option 2 - Fork repo and import to Glitch, edit on Glitch, and then export back to GitHub
Most of these steps are the same as option 1, except that you being by creating a new project Glitch using this repo as a staring point (just choose New Project > Import from GitHub for this and then paste in the link to your repo). At the end, you can export your Glitch project to GitHub by [following these instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=77&v=aWJFbtrgW4E&feature=emb_logo). *Note that the location of the projecct export feature in Glitch has moved from what they show in this video.* It's now located in Tools > Import and Export (tools is located in the bottom left of the Glitch editor).

## Option 3 - Clone to computer, edit locally, push to GitHub, upload to Glitch
This is the same as option 1, except that for step 6 (Deploy to Glitch) you simply upload each file to your Glitch repository (using New File > Upload a File).

Naming and URL Scheme
---

You must use a consistent naming scheme for all projects in this course.
If we can't find it, we can't grade it.

By default Glitch often assigns your application a random name. To change it, click on the project dropdown menu in the upper left corner of Glitch. You will then see an additional text field displaying the project name in the resulting menu; click here to edit the name.

The name scheme should be `a1-yourGitHubUsername`.
The `a1` will need to be updated to `a2`, `a3`, and so on in future projects.

Achievements
---
Below are some suggested technical and design achievements. You can use these to help boost your grade up to an A and customize the assignment to your personal interests. These are recommended acheivements, but feel free to create/implement your own... just make sure you thoroughly describe what you did in your README and why it was challenging. ALL ACHIEVEMENTS MUST BE DESCRIBED IN YOUR README IN ORDER TO GET CREDIT FOR THEM.

*Technical*
1. (max 5 points) Style your page using CSS. Each style rule you apply will get you 1 extra point for a maximum of 5 points. Be sure to describe your style rules in your README.
2. (5 points) Add a simple JavaScript animation to the page.
3. (max 5 points) Experiment with other HTML tags (links, images, tables etc.) Each extra tag you use will get you 1 extra point for a maximum of 5 points. Be sure to describe the links you use in your README.

*Design*
1. (10 points) Create a color palette using [color.adobe.com](https://color.adobe.com). Use all the colors in the palette in your webpage by implementing the appropriate CSS. Add a small screenshot of the color wheel for your color palette to your repo.
2. (5 points) Use a font from [Goolge Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) in your website.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: I filled in the headers and paragraphs with information about myself and my interest.I styled the color, background, font, alignment, spacing, padding, and height of each of these categories. I added an animation that I named 'pulse' to the title and title background. I played around with some other HTML tags, including adding a url to my LinkedIn, a table of my interests, an image at the top of the page, and an unordered list of my programming experience. 

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Open Sans and Lobster Fonts from Google Fonts**: I used Open Sans as the font for the primary copy text in my site, and Lobster for the title and headers. I also used color.adobe.com to generate a color pallet and used these colors in my design. I will add a screenshot of it to my repository.
