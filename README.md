This project shows all required parts of the first assignment along with all of the achievements completed. My name a short intro and my class at WPI are shown at the top. Next, is a list of the CS classes I've taken or am taking at WPI. After that is the 'Experience' section with a list of CS related jobs I've had and then a table with my proficiency with various web development skills. The page is styled with css and has a simple animation made using JS.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added css classes of .name-header, .intro, .list-holder, .list-header, section-header, and table-holder
along with their styles. box-sizing was set to border-box and margin and padding for all elements was eliminated with the * selector to make styling easier. Styles was also added to the ul, table, th, and tr elements. Most of the styles added was just custom margin and 
padding. My name and the experience header got centered, a border, and a background color. The list-headers got an underline. Lastly,
the table got alternating row colors on the rows along with some borders on certain parts of the table. A background color was also 
added to the body element. This is contained in 'index.css'.

- **JavaScript Animation**: Sent a JS file from the server and made the background of my name grow and shrink. This is contained in 'index.js'.

- **Other HTML Tags**: A table tag was used to disply my skills. th, tr, and td elements probably don't count for this achievement but I did use them. Div tags where used for styleing purposes. A link tag was used to link to the page's external css file and a style sheet for Google fonts. A script tag was used to access the page's external JS file. An hr tag was used before the 'Experience' header as a separator.

### Design Achievements
- **Adobe Color Palette**: All colors can be found in the index.css file.
