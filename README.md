This project shows a basic website constructed using HTML and CSS, and gives a little bit of information about me and my background. It also uses a very simple node.js server to serve the website. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the body, h1, h2, h3, and ul selectors. This included custom colors for all text (the h1, h2, h3 and ul selectors) and a custom font (Trebuchet MS) using `font-family` and a linear gradient as a background image using `background-image: linear-gradient`. In addition, a `no-repeat` rule was added so the linear gradient wouldn't try to restart before the bottom of the browser window. 

### Design Achievements
- **Custom color palette using color.adobe.com**: Using color.adobe.com, I chose a color palate using the "complementary" option on the color picker. This provided the colors for both my background gradient as well as all the types of headers and for the list elements. See below for the screenshot of the color palette:
