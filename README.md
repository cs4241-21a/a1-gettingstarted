This project shows a personal website with a history of my background in cs. It also shows a elementary use of html and css.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: 
Added rules for implementing the color palette throughout the text with color and background-color tags.
Added rules for changing the color of the bullet points in an order list based on [this w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_bullet_color.asp) page! IMO they all count as one style change because they induce the same singular effect.
Added rules for a zoom on hover for my image based on [this w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_zoom_hover.asp) page!
Added rules using the float tag to align the button and image to the right of my page.
Added css to make the button prettier.
- **Add Javascript Animation**: Clicking the spin button makes my image spin! Clicking it again makes me spin even faster! There is no stopping me! (unless you refresh)
- **Experimented with Other HTML tags**: 
Added a table tag for the experience section. I chose to not include a header to keep it more like a text list with better tabbing.
Added an image tag for a picture of myself and also for animation use.
Added a button tag to enable the animation of my image.
Added a link tag to add a strawberry favicon icon.

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Fredoka One Font from Google Fonts**: I used Fredoka One as the font for the text in my site.
- **Create Color Palette on Adobe.com**: I used a complementary based color palette. I checked thru the accessibility tools to ensure the colors are contrasted enough with the background and color blind safe!
